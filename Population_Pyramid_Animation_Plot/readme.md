# Animation of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Intercensal Mid-year Population Estimates from 1995 - 2010

This visualization was produced using data from the Malaysian Open Data Portal - www.data.gov.my which was contributed by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM)

Kuala Lumpur, being the most populous and urbanized city in Malaysia has been constantly experiencing an influx of people from the other states and territories in Malaysia and I thought it would be interesting to visualize the dynamics of it's population. Pyramid plots are good way of visualizing the population by sex and age groups and by animating the changes that have occured over 2.5 decades, we can see how the different age groups have changed over time.
