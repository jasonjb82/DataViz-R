# DataViz-R

This is my ([jasonjb82](https://jasonjb82.github.io/) / [@jasonjb82](https://twitter.com/jasonjb82)) place to publish data visualizations. Besides publishing code and work-in-progress images, I also use this to host my final visualizations. 

Each visualization I have produced is in a directory, typically with the following contents -

* An R-file used to create the data visualization
* An  graphic file (PNG, GIF, etc) which is the data visualization output
